# bcgen-lang &mdash; Engineering Directives

> Engineering standards and the definition of done for this project. Read alongside `REPS.md` (root, authoritative) and `dev/ROADMAP.md` (current phase). If anything here conflicts with `REPS.md`, `REPS.md` wins.
> Family plan: `../_lexersketch/` (README rules of engagement, ARCHITECTURE, ISSUES, ROADMAP).

## 0. Philosophy

This library is built and maintained to a production standard and treated as a flagship piece of work. Plan the full path, then build one verified step at a time. "Good enough" is treated as a defect. It is part of the LexerSketch runtime tier (LXRT) of the `-lang` family that LexerSketch assembles.

---

## 1. What this is

bcgen-lang owns the HIR to LSB translation: register allocation over LSB's register windows, closure conversion and capture layout, pattern-match compilation via match-lang decision trees, exception and finally lowering per LSB's canonical scheme, coroutine frames, and debug line tables mapping every instruction back to its HIR origin. It does not parse, resolve, type-check, or execute.

It is the bridge that makes the Demo, the REPL, and hybrid bytecode units real (LexerSketch decision D19), and it is shared by every forged language.

## 2. Engineering law (non-negotiable)

- **Ours, not rented.** No third-party runtime dependency. First-party `-lang` crates only, wired when first used. Dev-only test tooling is allowed.
- **Performance.** Peak is the baseline: allocation-free hot paths where feasible, dense ids instead of maps, no "faster" claim without `criterion` numbers at realistic scale (100k+ items).
- **Correctness.** Every invariant in section 4 is covered by property tests, cross-checked against a simple reference implementation wherever one can be written.
- **Hostile-input hardening.** Any input this crate accepts may be adversarial: explicit budgets (depth, size, steps), iterative algorithms, no quadratic paths, no reachable panics.
- **Architecture.** SOLID, KISS, YAGNI; one responsibility; a Tier-1 one-call entry point headlines the docs.
- **Cross-platform.** Linux, macOS, and Windows are first-class, verified by CI on stable and MSRV 1.85.
- **Error handling.** Every fallible path returns `Result`/`Option` per a documented contract; errors are `#[non_exhaustive]` and actionable.
- **Production-ready.** `#![forbid(unsafe_code)]` and `#![deny(missing_docs)]` from the first commit; no `unwrap`/`expect`/`todo!`/`dbg!`/printing in library code; every public item has rustdoc with a runnable example; every claim in the docs maps to a test.

## 3. Definition of done

1. Compiles clean on Linux/macOS/Windows, stable and MSRV 1.85.
2. `fmt`, `clippy -D warnings` (all targets, all/no-default features), `test --all-features`, `cargo doc -D warnings` clean.
3. `cargo audit` + `cargo deny check` pass.
4. No `unwrap`/`expect`/`todo!`/`dbg!` in shipping code.
5. A Tier-1 API exists and headlines the docs.
6. Property tests cover every section-4 invariant; a fuzz target exists for every decoder or parser.
7. Hot-path changes carry benchmarks; no regression over 5%.
8. `README.md`, `docs/API.md`, and `CHANGELOG.md` updated; the matching `docs/release/vX.Y.Z.md` written before the tag.
9. v1.0.0 only after a real consumer has exercised the API end to end (LexerSketch decision D18).

## 4. Project-specific invariants

- Every module it emits loads in bvm-lang and passes the LSB verifier once that exists; it never emits an out-of-range register, constant, or branch target.
- Semantics are preserved: a differential test runs each program through a reference HIR interpreter in the tests and through bvm-lang, with identical results, errors, and error locations.
- Every instruction carries a debug location that maps back to the HIR origin of the code it came from.
- Compilation is iterative, budgeted, and deterministic.
